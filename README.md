Description
You are tasked with building a minimalist command-line application using Ruby. Given a
JSON dataset with clients (attached), the application will need to offer two commands:
Search through all clients and return those with names partially matching a given
search query
Find out if there are any clients with the same email in the dataset, and show those
duplicates if any are found.
```
